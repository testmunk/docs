Testmunk documentation
======================

This is the testmunk documentation repo. It builds using `sphinx`.

This repo has the theme repo as a git submodule. For more info on how to pull the submodule: http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules

Make sure to do all theme building, editing, and updating is done in a clone of its own repository, as opposed to a clone of this one. You can then update your local copy of the submodule with the instructions on the previous link.
