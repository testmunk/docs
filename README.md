Testmunk documentation
======================

This is testmunk's documentation, you build it with `sphinx`.

Right now I am copying the built theme into this repo and pushing it. In the future it might be advisable to set the built theme folder from the theme repo as a git subtree of this one. If you do that, make sure to subtree only the built theme instead of the whole theme repo, or it will cause problems with Read The Docs.
